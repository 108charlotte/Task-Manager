# Task Manager
A full-stack application built with React, Django, and PostgreSQL, containerized with Docker (through Docker Compose), and ultimately hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. This project was created during my internship with the Administrative Office of the Courts's (AOC) development team to gain a better understanding of containerization and hosting theory through practice. It also inspired my [tutorial](https://108charlotte.github.io/Full-Stack-with-Docker-and-AWS-Tutorial/) (code [here](https://github.com/108charlotte/Full-Stack-with-Docker-and-AWS-Tutorial)), which instructs users unfamiliar with Docker and AWS on how to build this project, teaching them about how those technologies work and providing hands-on experience. 

## Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Django
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker
- Hosting: AWS
